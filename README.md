# Webpack setup

An example setup for webpack.

## Building

1. Run `yarn`
1. Run `yarn run build`
1. Run `yarn run serve` to start a simple webserver to serve the built files.
1. Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

## For dev setup

Did not really setup something for development, but the plan was to setup webpack hot reloading with webpack-dev-server.

## Webpack 3?

Maybe later.
